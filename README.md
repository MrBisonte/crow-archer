### Wizard
Teleguided magic with area control.
- **Primary:** Magic bolts — 3 s cooldown, automatically home toward nearest enemy, disappear on contact
- **Special:** Lightning Storm — massive 450 px AoE around the player; destroys ROCK and TREE tiles, damages all enemies
- **Pickups:** Fire bolt (2× damage) · Laser stream (passes through walls, stops on first enemy)

### Knight *(NEW)*
Frontline melee fighter with a long spear.
- **Primary:** Spear thrust — 80 px directional cone, 0.9 s cooldown, 2 damage to boss
- **Special:** Whirlwind — 3-second spinning AoE (72 px radius); continuously damages enemies and destroys ROCK/TREE tiles; 8 s cooldown

## Gamification Systems

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **FORESHADOW** | Sky tint darkens and banners appear at kill milestones leading up to the boss |
| **STREAK** | UT99-style announcer: Double Kill → Multi Kill → Mega Kill → Ultra Kill → Monster Kill |
| **FEATHERS** | Meta-currency earned from kills, persisted in `localStorage`. Spend on upgrades (arrows, HP, range, speed) via the in-game inventory screen |
| **HANDICAP** | `CONFIG.handicap` (0–100) rubber-bands crow speed and drop rate for accessibility |
| **BOUNTIES** | Two active micro-objectives tied to kill streaks; grant bonus rewards on completion |

## Map

- **25 × 16** procedural tile grid (EMPTY · ROCK · WATER · TREE · ASH)
- Player spawns in a guaranteed clear zone; crows enter from the right corridor
- Trees burn to ash on boss arrival, opening the arena
- Dynamite and Lightning Storm destroy ROCK and TREE tiles permanently

## Audio

All sound is synthesized via Web Audio API (no audio files). Sounds initialize on first user gesture.

## Technical Notes

- Pure vanilla JS — no frameworks, no bundler
- Single `<canvas>` element; all UI drawn via Canvas 2D API
- CRT scanline aesthetic via CSS + vignette overlay
- Particle system capped at 120 active particles (oldest dropped first)
- Delta-time game loop via `requestAnimationFrame`
- All tunable values centralized in the `CONFIG` object at the top of `game.html`
